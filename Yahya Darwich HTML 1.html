        <h1>What is Git?</h1>
        <p>So, what is <b>Git</b> in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other <b>VCSs</b>, such as <b>CVS</b>, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using </p>
        <h2>Snapshots, Not Differences</h2>
        <p>The major difference between <b>Git</b> and any other <b>VCS</b> (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).</p>
        <h2>Nearly Every Operation Is Local</h2>
        <p>Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate — generally no information is needed from another computer on your network.<br> If you’re used to a <strong>CVCS</strong> where most operations have that network latency overhead, this aspect of Git will make you think that the gods of speed have blessed Git with unworldly powers. Because you have the entire history of the project right there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>To browse the history of the project, Git doesn’t need to go out to the server to get the history and display it for you — it simply reads it directly from your local database. This means you see the project history almost instantly. <br>If you want to see the changes introduced between the current version of a file and the file a month ago, Git can look up the file a month ago and do a local difference calculation, instead of having to either ask a remote server to do it or pull an older version of the file from the remote server to do it locally.</p>

                <i>The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance is the “index”, but the phrase “staging area” works just as well.

                    The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project.<br> This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.</i>
