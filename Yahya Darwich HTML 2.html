             So, what is <b>Git</b> in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other <b>VCSs</b>, such as <b>CVS</b>, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using

            <article>The major difference between <b>Git</b> and any other <b>VCS</b> (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

            <article>
                <p>Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate — generally no information is needed from another computer on your network.<br> If you’re used to a <strong>CVCS</strong> where most operations have that network latency overhead, this aspect of Git will make you think that the gods of speed have blessed Git with unworldly powers. Because you have the entire history of the project right there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous.</p>

                <p>To browse the history of the project, Git doesn’t need to go out to the server to get the history and display it for you — it simply reads it directly from your local database. This means you see the project history almost instantly. <br>If you want to see the changes introduced between the current version of a file and the file a month ago, Git can look up the file a month ago and do a local difference calculation, instead of having to either ask a remote server to do it or pull an older version of the file from the remote server to do it locally.</p>

            The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
            <ol>
                <li>You modify files in your working tree.</li>
                <li>You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area.
                </li>
                <li>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.
                </li>
                <li>Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.</li>
                <li>Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
                </li>
            </ol>
